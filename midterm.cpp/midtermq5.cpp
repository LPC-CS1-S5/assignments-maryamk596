// Make your program that asks for two user input num1 and num2 (integer) and calculate the integer division n1/n2 if n1 > n2. Otherwise n2/n1. And then, the result must be written into the file "question5.txt". If the two numbers are the same, we will stop the program.

//Make the function getInput to take two user input
//Make the function isSame to check two numbers are the same. This function could be used as an exit condition of the loop structure.
//Make the function intDivision to calculate the division.
//Make the function fileWrite to write the division result to a file
//Make the main function to drive all these functions
//All other considerations for designing the programs can be set by your algorithms and your design specification.

//the number of parameters, parameter data type, return value and type, and so on.
